# The Scouts - Recruitment Management System

## Project Overview

**The Scouts** is a robust web-based system designed to facilitate the recruitment and paper submission process within academic and institutional environments. Developed as part of a university capstone project, this system addresses key challenges faced by both applicants and administrators, providing a streamlined, secure, and scalable digital platform for managing submissions, job postings, and application reviews.

The primary goal is to bridge the gap between candidates seeking academic or professional positions and institutions looking for qualified individuals, while also supporting academic paper submission workflows.
